# Pomodoro Advent of JavaScript, CSS

In this project, we're creating a Pomodoro timer.

For this pomodoro an npm package called sqhtml was used, which is my authorship.

## Develop

### Install

in order to install this project for editing use the following commands in terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

If we want to make changes, we start the console, we will locate ourselves in the root of the project and we will use the following command:

```bash
nodemon --ext html,js,css,scss ./config/serve.js
```

And in another terminal we execute

```bash
gulp -browser -sync
```
